# CS-330-Project
Module Eight Submission for CS 330 at SNHU

1. How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  Working on the project, I learned how to create and modify a torus. It seemed tricky at first but I was able to find a header file for a torus mesh and it was just a matter of tweaking the matrix to get the appropriate dimensions.

  What design process did you follow for you project work?
  My process consisted of selecting an object to render, then drawing the object and texturing it. After that I moved on to the next one and the next one until each object was drawn and textured.

  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  I found that other people have done a tremendous amount of the legwork for me, and post it in forums for others to use and modify for their particular implementation.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  The main strategy I used was manipulating base code from LearnOpenGL to fit what I needed.

  How did iteration factor into your development?
  When drawing a circular object I had to use iteration to draw the mesh for it.

  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project's completion?
  At first I was creating my own mesh from scratch by manually inputting each vertex and index, but soon that become overwhelming and at that point I was implementing iteration to make that task much more manageable.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  Learning about graphics gave me great insight on how a computer makes complex calculations like matrix transformations. This will undeniably crossover into other courses at SNHU.

  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  I imagine that at some point in my career I would find it useful to use 3D graphics in order to demonstrate a visual concept or idea.
